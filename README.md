# Gumroad overlay

Including `gumroad.js` script will convert Gumroad links to an inline embed so that the user can buy an item straight from the page where a Gumroad link is located. 

## Usage

1. Include `gumroad.js`
2. Any Gumroad link (`gum.co`, `gumroad.com` domains) will be converted into an inline embed (instead of default link behaviour, the Gumroad item will open in a widget)
3. To opt out of the behaviour described above, add a `data-gumroad-embed="false"` attribute to selected links 

## Example

See index.html
